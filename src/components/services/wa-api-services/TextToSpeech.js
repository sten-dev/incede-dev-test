            <strong>Advanced Machine Learning</strong>
            <p>
              Text to Speech service offers voices that rely on two types of technology: neural voice technology and concatenative synthesis. Both technologies synthesize speech from input text, but they use different approaches to produce audio with different characteristics. Neural (V3) voices are enhanced versions of the service's original concatenative voices.

              Languages and voices
            </strong>
            <p>
              The Text to Speech service supports a variety of languages, voices, and dialects. The service offers at least one female voice for each language. For some languages the service offers multiple voices, including both male and female voices. Each voice uses appropriate cadence and intonation for its dialect.
