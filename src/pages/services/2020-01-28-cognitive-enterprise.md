Search with artificial intelligence (AI) to deliver actionable information and data derived from a rich spectrum of content types and sources, both inside and outside the enterprise. Cognitive Search Solutions that doesn’t just extract information – it crawls complex business documents serves up answers with context, leading businesses to insights impossible to derive otherwise.

##### Key Capabilities 

* **Understands business documents :** Traditional search can’t fully understand the structure of your complex business documents because they contain industry-specific content and exist in different formats – like PDFs, Excel tables, and PowerPoints – that are visually difficult for traditional search to interpret. With Smart Document Understanding (SDU), you can visually label the text within your enterprise documents (from headers and footers, to tables, and so on) allowing Watson Discovery to surface the exact answer from a body of text or section. Thanks to machine learning, once you train SDU on a few pages, you can begin to apply that understanding to hundreds.
* **Powered by machine learning :** Your search tool needs to continue to learn and improve over time. Watson Discovery’s Integrated Machine Learning capabilities allow it to continuously improve from user interactions and enables users to create and deploy custom machine learning models based on domain expertise faster than ever before. Watson Discovery Machine Learning features include relevancy ranking, text analytics, custom model optimization, and more.
* **Integrates with conversational AI to find answers to your questions :** Most chatbots frustrate users when asked detailed questions, relaying that they don’t understand and can’t provide an accurate answer. Watson Discovery’s integration with IBM’s award-winning conversational AI, Watson Assistant, enables users to retrieve both pre-trained answers as well as more complex content found in their knowledge bases, product manuals, project reports, and more. It’s so much more than a chatbot.
