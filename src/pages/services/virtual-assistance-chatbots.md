Watson Assistant is IBM’s AI product that lets you build, train, and deploy conversational interactions into any application, device, or channel. 

Chatbots are the new apps! Build custom AI-Powered chatbots for your enterprise to create smarter business workflows, improve employee productivity, reduce operational costs, and enhance decision-making. Industry Analysts predicts that by 2021, 50% of enterprises will spend more per annum on chatbot creation than traditional mobile app development!

Most chatbots try to mimic human interactions, which can frustrate users when a misunderstanding arises. Watson Assistant is more. It knows when to search for an answer from a knowledge base, when to ask for clarity and when to direct users to a human. Watson Assistant can be deployed in any cloud or on-premises environment – meaning smarter AI is finally available wherever you need it.
