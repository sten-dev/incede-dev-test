Extend the standard policies & procedures role of HR Services by offering personalized information anytime, anywhere.  Incede engages employees to quickly answer their questions such as vacation accruals, overtime eligibility or training & certification statuses.  Natural Language Understanding (NLU) allows Incede to connect your employees with new and innovative information areas such as mental health care resources, traumatic event support and learning & growth recommendations.

Incede integrates and ingests employee, benefits, projects and other information from your systems to personalize the conversations.  Engaging conversations and escalations ensure your employees feel supported, enabled and productive â€“ everyday.

Incede improves compliance and conformance by presenting employee-specific information they need by surfacing important policies, procedures, regulations and other requirements that have been, until now, trapped in volumes of handbooks, guides and manuals.
