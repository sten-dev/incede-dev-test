IT Services are the backbone of the organization – including the IT service desk.  Incede provides quick resolution to the routine, low-value issues – the typical Level 1 requests.  Natural Language Understanding (NLU) allows Incede to address more complex requests that have traditionally been escalated to the support team – the typical Level 2 requests.

Incede integrates and ingests employee, system, support ticket and other information from your systems to improve the effectiveness of the conversations and the speed of resolution.  Interactive problem-resolution dialogs engage employees to get back to their day jobs quickly – including the IT Support team.

When escalations are needed, Incede is at work there too. Incede searches and surfaces volumes of service request histories, system documentation, frequently asked questions and other resources to suggest sophisticated answers to complex requests.
