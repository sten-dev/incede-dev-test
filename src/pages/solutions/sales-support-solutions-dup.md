Sellers want to get it right and they have the brand’s loyalty and customer’s experience at stake.  Incede’s Natural Language Understanding (NLU) allows salespeople to effectively engage and confirm the right solution for the customer – without delays, without taxing engineering and without deciphering the volumes of specifications.

Incede integrates and ingests customer order history, product & service data and other information from your systems to support matching and cross-matching a customer’s need with a solution.  Incede’s integrated AI enables sellers to market the value that customers expect and appreciate.

Incede ends the time-consuming and randomized results from searching the product manuals, service offerings, engineering specifications, cross-reference tables, frequently asked questions and other libraries of unstructured volumes by presenting only the relevant information they want, need and deserve – to sell and close business.
